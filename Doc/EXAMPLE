NOT FINISHED YET :

At my students'union I use the following setup :

On the server :

/usr/local/bin/mpg123
/usr/local/bin/findmp3
/usr/local/bin/mjs
/home/jukebox/.mjsrc
/tftpdir/gandalf.mp3net/	root of the mp3jukebox

also I exported over nfs (taken from /etc/exports)

/tftpdir/gandalf.bolkhuis	gandalf(rw,no_root_squash)
/pub/mp3			gandalf(ro)
/usr                            gandalf(ro,no_root_squash)


The jukebox is a so called diskless client, so it contains no harddisks.
This makes managing it a lot easier. You can do everything from behind your
own machine. It is also no problem when the power of the jukebox is turned
off without halting the system, because it doesn't contain harddisks.

On the server the mp3db.cron script is placed in /etc/cron.daily to keep the
mp3database up to date. 

Also the setrights_mp3.cron script is placed in /etc/cron.daily to make sure
the rights of the mp3 are correct, although this is only nice for other un*x
machines connected to the server so they don't try to executed mp3's or
things like that.

The player software is started on the client from /etc/inittab by the
following entry :

j:4:respawn:open -c 01 -s -w -l -- su -s /bin/ash -l jukebox -c 'killall -9\
mpg123;/usr/local/bin/mjs'

as you an see it runs in runlevel 4. It opens a login for user jukebox on
VT 1 and the kills any existing orphan mpg123's and then starts mjs.
