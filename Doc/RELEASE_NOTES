There exist three small problems which I would love to resolve but seem not
so simple:
* When using mjs under RedHat 8.0 console (Virtual Terminal) first execute
  the command reset. Otherwise the console will not be working properly. 
* In an xterm (under RedHat 8.0) changing the TERM environment variable to
  xterm-color resolves some screen corruption.
* When compiling under RedHat 7.3 for RedHat 6.0 everything goes well, but
  to run mjs you have to set the keep_playlist_at_exit option to false or else
  a segfault will occur.
