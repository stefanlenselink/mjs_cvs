/*
 * Ok, this is an enormous pain in the ass. If you know anything about ansi,
 * then you know that there are 8 possible foreground colors and 8 possible
 * background colors. BUT, with the bold flag, the 8 foreground colors
 * become 16. With the reverse video flag combined with bold, the number of
 * background colors on SOME terminals becomes 16. UNFORTUNATELY, the
 * reverse flag doesn't really increase the number of colors -- it flips the
 * possibilities! So if you want 16 colors for the background then you only
 * have 8 choices for the foreground. Ugh.  But all is not lost :)... If you
 * now add in the blinking flag, some terms map this out to allowing the
 * full range of colors in foreground and the background. But it is only
 * SOME terminals. Because of this, I have chosen to stick with 16
 * foreground and 8 background colors. Those of you who know (or figure out)
 * how ncurses stores these attributes internally can easily take advantages
 * of things like this. However, for simplicity I have decided to stick with
 * a 16/8 combo. I'm not using the reverse/blink flag to get the full range
 * of colors.
