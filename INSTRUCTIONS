Loosely pieced together... read_key() is where this stuff is from...

********** NOTE ***********
If you core due to some lame bug, you may need to kill the mpg123
child process. It goes berzerk if you orphan it.

Customization:

Thanks to Trent Gamblin, you have the option of an MMS rc file. Either
create your own .mmsrc or set the env variable MMSRC. An example
configuration file is provided, see "mmsrc.EXAMPLE".

Navigation:

TAB cycles between active windows.
ARROW KEYS are for basic navigation. pgup/pgdn, home/end also work.

* in ALL windows:
   * 'F1' reset mp3-jukebox
   * 'F2' will clear the playlist after confirmation
   * 'F3' lets you search files
   * 'F4' shows your last search results
   * 'F5' will randomize the playlist
   * 'F7' will stop the player
   * 'F8' will pause the player
   * 'F9' will go back one song
   * 'F10' will fast rewind
   * 'F11' will fast forward
   * 'F12' will advance one song

 * in the files window:
   * return adds files to the playlist and changes directory.
   * left-arrow goes back one directory
   * right-arrow enters directory
   * alt-enter inserts selected file into playlist
   * Pressing an letter will take you to the first directory starting with
     that letter   
* in the playlist window is where the good stuff goes on:
   * with + and - you can move mp3's forward or backward in the playlist 
   * DEL will remove a song from the playlist (unless it is playing!)
