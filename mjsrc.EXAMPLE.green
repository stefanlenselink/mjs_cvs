# Window positions and sizes and formats (only used for 'list' type windows)
#
# Window format tokens:
# 
# %t - the song title
# %a - the artist
# %f - filename
# %F - complete filename, incl path
# %p - the path
# %P - the path without the mp3path part
# %% - like with printf, insert a %
#
# + - * / operators are ok. Use 'w' and 'h' for screen width and height.
# A 0 for width/height will go from x/y to the max.
#
# Be careful here. Don't put spaces in expressions. Borders will take up
# two spaces. If you screw up things can overlap and look ugly.
#
# title.format  = format string for the title (optional)
# title.default = default title, if no formats apply (optional, has a default)
