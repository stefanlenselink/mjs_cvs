Needed libraries:
* ncurses
* panel

Needed program:
* Patched mpg123 or mpg321

So, why do I need to patch mpg123 : Because when using mpg123's
remote interface and buffering, when you hit stop, ffw or fbw, pause
or next/previous track, it will keep playing until it has played it's
buffer empty before doing the wanted action.

Download the patched sources from 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=37569&release_id=91418
, compile and install them.

Or download the latest mpg123 (pre0.59s) from www.mpg123.de and patch it
E.g. do patch -i <location of patch-mpg123-pre-s> in the mpg123 source
directory.

It is also possible to use mpg321, although it
does not support buffering and webradio sounds bad.

Quick installation:

1) You probably don't need to edit the Makefile.
2) Type "make".

To use the search function of mjs, you need to do the following simple
steps :

3) edit the file mp3db.cron so that it suits your directory structure and
   put it in /etc/cron.daily or alike
4) edit the file findmp3 so that it suits your directory structure


5) Run "make install" as root.
6) Create a configuration file (example provided as mmsrc.EXAMPLE) in
   $HOME/.mjsrc.  Set the path to the player and a couple of various
   options. This is also where you configure window sizes, positions and
   colors.
7) Install an intro mp3 as /usr/local/share/intro.mp3
   Make sure you can play it with mpg123 as first song
8) enjoy!
