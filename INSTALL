Quick installation:

1) You probably don't need to edit the Makefile.
2) Type "make".

To use the search function of mjs, you need to do the following simple
steps :

3) edit the file mp3db.cron so that it suits your directory structure and
   put it in /etc/cron.daily or alike
4) edit the file findmp3 so that it suits your directory structure


5) Run "make install" as root.
6) Create a configuration file (example provided as mmsrc.EXAMPLE) in
   $HOME/.mjsrc.  Set the path to the player and a couple of various
   options. This is also where you configure window sizes, positions and
   colors.
7) enjoy!
